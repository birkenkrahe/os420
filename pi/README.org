* Rasperry Pi 2 WiFi networking  <2022-01-05 Wed>
**  Problem
   WiFi dongle present (and powered - check with ~iwconfig
   -a~) but ~iwconfig~ shows no network activity, and ~ping~ is not
   working (website not recognized).

** Solution
   * Edit ~/etc/network/interfaces~ with the ~nano~ editor and put in
     the code block [[wlan]]. Put in the name (~ssid~) and WPA-~password~
     (you find these on your router), and save the file (~C-x y RET~).

   #+name: wlan
   #+begin_src sh
     # The loopback network interface
     auto lo
     iface lo inet loopback

     # The primary (wired) network interface
     iface eth0 inet dhcp

     # The wifi (wireless) network interface
     auto wlan0
     allow-hotplug wlan0
     iface wlan0 inet dhcp
     wpa-ssid "ssid"
     wpa-psk "password"
   #+end_src

   * Restart the Pi: ~sudo shutdown -r now~. Check that WiFi is up with [[iwconfig]]:
   #+name:iwconfig
   #+begin_src sh
     # display status of all interfaces
     iwconfig -a
     ping r-project.org
   #+end_src

   * ~sudo apt update~ and ~sudo apt upgrade -y~ to bring system up to
     date.
   * For WPA2/AES security, [[https://coderwall.com/p/v290ta/raspberry-pi-wifi-setup-with-wpa2-psk-aes][see here]].
   * To enable automatic reconnect, install ~wicd~ and start
     ~wicd-curses~:

* Installing GNU Emacs  <2022-01-05 Wed>
  I need my favorite editor on the Pi (though ~nano~ does a good job
  for simple tasks)!

  * Check available disk space with ~df -h~.
  * ~sudo apt install emacs~

* Create an ~ssh~ tunnel for remote access  <2022-01-05 Wed>

  * Enable ~ssh~ via the ~raspi-config~ menu
  * You can make sure that the service is up with ~sudo service
    --status-all~
  * For Windows: get ~PuTTY~ (MSI 64-bit x86 installer)
  * Get the IP address of the Pi with ~sudo hostname -I~. This will be
    the IP address on the local network (~192.168.1.135~)
  * Upon the first connect attempt, pick ~Access~ to establish the
    server's key (and make sure that it is trusted)
  * Login with the Pi's username and password, and you should be in.

    #+name:ssh

    And now I'm running GNU Emacs over ~ssh~:

    To increase the font size in this window, right-click on the
    frame:

    #+begin_example
    Change Settings
    Window
     Appearance
      Change Font
      Apply
    #+end_example

    #+name:font
    #+attr_html: :width 500px
    [[./img/font.png]]

    You can also save the PuTTY session (but be aware that the
    hostname is likely to change when the WiFi connection drops
    intermittently):

* Running ~ssh~ inside Emacs with ~Tramp~ <2022-01-05 Wed>

  * Refresh Emacs package list: ~M-x package-refresh-contents~
  * Upgrade packages (~U x RET~) in ~M-x packages-list-packages~
  * Get the ~Tramp~ package via *Packages*
  * Put ~plink.exe~ from the PuTTY folder into the Windows ~PATH~
  * In Emacs, execute
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    Dired (directory): /plink:pi@192.168.1.136:/
  #+end_src
  * Enter the password and you're in.

    #+name:plink
    #+attr_html: :width 600px
    [[./img/plink.png]]

    * Advantage: now you can run a proper Linux shell inside Emacs
    * ~M-x package-install RET tramp-theme RET~ installs custom theme
      (slight adaptation of the modeline)
