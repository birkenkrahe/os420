* README

  This file contains the agenda overview (what I had planned), the
  objectives (what we managed to do) and (much of the) content of each
  taught session of the course. I want to avoid splitting the content
  up over many files - so that you have to navigate as little as
  possible (like a book)!

  The companion file to this file, less structured and with the
  captain's log, is the [[./notes.org][notes.org]] file.

** Summary: foundations of operating systems
*** 10 tenets
    1) An operating system is software that manages the computer
       hardware, as well as providing an environment for application
       programs to run.

    2) Interrupts are a key way in which hardware interacts with the
       operating system. A hardware device triggers an interrupt by
       sending a signal to alert the CPU, whose interrupt handler
       manages the interrupt.

    3) For a computer to do its job, programs must be loaded in main
       memory (RAM), which is the only memory area that the CPU can
       access directly.

    4) To best utilize the CPU, the OS can handle several jobs in
       memory at the same time so that there's always one job to
       execute. True multitasking, however, is an illusion.

    5) To prevent user programs from interfering, the system hardware
       has two modes: user mode and kernel ("sudo") mode.

    6) Privileged instructions that can only be executed in kernel mode
       include: switching to kernel mode; I/O control; time management;
       interrupt management.

    7) Process management includes creating and deleting processes, and
       providing process communication and synchronization. Processes
       are active, programs are passive.

    8) Memory management means that the OS keeps track of what parts of
       memory are being used and by whom, and dynamically freeing and
       allocating memory.

    9) Storage space is managed by the OS through file systems (files,
       directories) and managing space on mass-storage devices.

    10) Virtualization involves abstracting a computer's hardware into
        several different execution environments.

*** Short definition

    #+begin_quote
    The Operating System takes physical resources (CPU, memory, disk),
    and *virtualizes* them. It handles *concurrent* processes, and it
    stores files *persistently* to make them safe in the long term.
    #+end_quote

*** OS attributes

    - *Performance* / overhead reduction
    - *Protection* between applications, and between OS and apps
    - *Isolation* of processes from one another
    - *Reliability* of operations
    - *Security* against malicious attacks
    - *Mobility* across, and towards smaller, and embedded devices

*** OS Timeline

    | Early era        | OS are just libraries with (human) batch operators |
    | Mainframe era    | Protection through the system handler              |
    | Minicomputer era | Interrupt-based memory management                  |
    | PC era           | DOS attacks and infinite MacOS loops               |
    | Modern era       | Linux and the return to sanity                     |

** DataCamp course: Introduction to Shell

   #+begin_quote
   This chapter is a brief introduction to the Unix shell. You'll learn
   why it is still in use after almost 50 years, how it compares to the
   graphical tools you may be more familiar with, how to move around in
   the shell, and how to create, modify, and delete files and folders.
   #+end_quote

** Three shells inside Emacs!

   * Works really well only under Linux or MacOS

   | SHELL COMMAND | CHARACTERISTICS         | MODELINE     |
   |---------------+-------------------------+--------------|
   | ~M-x shell~   | Windows shell ~CMD.exe~ | ~*shell*~    |
   | ~M-x eshell~  | Lisp simulated shell    | ~*eshell*~   |
   | ~M-x term~    | Terminal emulator       | ~*terminal*~ |

   Cp. the variable ~shell-file-name~.

   * Start Emacs from the terminal: ~emacs -nw -q~
   * Start all three shells in Emacs
   * Start Emacs with ~emacs -nw inside an Emacs ~*shell*~

     #+begin_quote
     You should get the error message ~emacs: standard input is not a
     tty~. TTY stands for "TeleTYpewriter". The (Unix) ~tty~ command is
     used to check if the output is a terminal or not (see [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tty_(Unix)][Wikipedia]]).

   | Pi Practice | Understanding the shell and Unix man pages         |

** Objectives

   * [X] Review Introduction to the shell - Files and folders (Quiz 3)

   * [X] Getting OS release information

   * [X] Understand the shell(s) - Unix man pages

   * [ ] Understand the Linux file tree

** Setting up the Linux boxes (almost every session)

   This is something you can do as soon as you arrive:

   * Take out the [Raspberry] Pi
   * Connect the HDMI from the KVM switch to the Pi
   * Connect the USB from the KVM switch to the Pi (any USB port)
   * Plug in the power charger under the desk
   * Connect the mini-USB of the power charger to the Pi
   * Press the button on the KVM switch (color changes to green)
   * The system should boot straight to console with autologin as user
     ~pi~

   The Ethernet cable is not usually needed except for installations
   and for updates and upgrades.

   For the Pi400, the setup is slightly different because the Pi4 has
   a mini-HDMI connector.

** Understanding the shell

   #+begin_quote
   "Typing commands instead of clicking and dragging may seem clumsy
   at first, but as you will see, once you start spelling out what you
   want the computer to do, you can *combine* old commands to create
   new ones and *automate* repetitive operations with just a few
   keystrokes." (Shotts, 2019)
   #+end_quote

   * The shell is just another program to pass keyboard commands to
     the OS

   * On the desktop GUI, the shell is emulated (an X Windows program
     connects to it and interpretes key strokes, just like ~eshell~ on
     Emacs)

   * The original shell is the Bourne Shell (~/bin/shell~).

   * Linux uses an enhanced Bourne Shell, the Bourne-Again SHell
     ~bash~.

   * [X] Look up the man page for ~bash~ with the command ~man bash~ [fn:3].

   * [X] To get out, press ~q~

   * There are many other shells, including: ~ksh~ (Korn shell), ~csh~ (C shell),
     ~zsh~ (MacOS shell).

   * Different shells differ in editing styles (command line editing),
     scripting abilities (e.g. closer to C), and process management
     functions (what you can do with CPU processes).

   * Emacs commands are Unix commands: ~C-a~, ~C-e~ etc. all work

   * Some other shell commands to try now:
     - [X] ~history~ keeps the last 1000 commands or so. Commands are
       numbered. How can you repeat a command?
     - [X] ~date~ and ~cal~ time functions
     - [X] ~df~ and ~df -H~ (for humans) show the free disk space
     - [X] ~free~ and ~free -h~ (for humans) show the free memory
     - [X] ~echo~ repeats back what you type - except when you use
       variables as arguments:
       #+begin_example
       $ echo $PS1 # prompt path name

** Objectives

   1) [ ] Poll/Discussion: should you upgrade your OS?

   2) [ ] Understand Thursday test rules and content

   3) [ ] Review shell command structure

   4) [ ] Understand the Linux file system structure and content

   5) [ ] Start an interactive Org-mode notebook

   6) [ ] Understand navigation and the Linux file tree

   7) [ ] Understand how to manipulate data using the shell

** Test info

   * Online in Schoology
   * Quiz 1-3 are not visible during the test
   * The 10 hardest questions of quiz 1-3 (< 50%)
   * 10 brand new questions
   * Maximum time = 45 min

** Review: shell command structure

   * The structure of all shell commands: [cmd] -[options] [arguments]

   * There must be > 1 space between all elements

   * There must not be a space between the option and the dash

   * Many commands have an ~-v~ option that provides you with
     information at run-time

   * There are short options (e.g. ~-l~) and long options (e.g. ~--reverse~)
     #+caption: long time listing of Org-files (and reversion)
     #+attr_html: :width 600px
     [[./img/struct.png]]

   * Another useful long option for the ~emacs~ command that starts
     GNU Emacs is ~--chdir=[dirname]~ where ~[dirname]~ is the name of
     the folder where you want Emacs to "wake up"

** Shell warm-up exercise

   Complete the exercise on the command line (15 min):

   | Go to your ~$home~ directory, ~/home/pi~                      |
   | Use ~wget~ to get ~sample.txt~ from ~os420~ in GitHub[fn:4]   |
   | Display first line of ~sample.txt~                            |
   | Make a sub directory titled ~practice~ in ~$home~             |
   | Change directory to ~/home/pi/practice~                       |
   | Verify that you are where you want to be                      |
   | Move ~sample.txt~ to your current directory as ~sample_1.txt~ |
   | Make a copy of ~sample_1.txt~ and name it ~sample_2.txt~      |
   | Ascertain that the files are indeed identical by using ~diff~ |
   | View both files together using ~less~                         |
   | Inside ~less~, move between the two files                     |
   | Leave ~less~                                                  |

** Manipulating files and directories

   * Files are organized in a hierarchical directory structure[fn:5]

   * Imagine you stand somewhere inside an upside down tree:
     - the ~pwd~ command tells you were you are
     - above you (towards the root) are /parent directories/
     - below you (away from the root) are /child directories/
     - At the top is the /root directory/
       #+caption: upside down tree
       #+attr_html: :width 500px
       [[./img/tree.jpeg]]

   * [ ] To see the tree visualized, install the package as super user:
     #+begin_example
     $ sudo apt install tree
     $ tree
     #+end_example

     #+caption: Linux tree command (screenshot)
     #+attr_html: :width 500px
     [[./img/tree.png]]

   * To list files, use ~ls~. It has many useful options. I usually
     use ~ls -la~ to get a long, complete listing. This is also the
     standard ~Dired~ setting in Emacs.

   * [ ] Compare ~ls~, ~ls -l~, ~ls -la~, ~ls -lF~, and ~ls -laF~

   * [ ] Which command would show the top directories of the OS?[fn:6]

   * To create an empty file, use ~touch~

   * [ ] Create a file from the command line with ~touch~.

   * Filenames are character-sensitive.

   * Don't embed spaces in file names, replace them by ~_~

   * Linux has no concept of file extensions - though many
     applications do (like Emacs, to identify a major mode like
     Org-mode)

   * Hidden files (often for configuration like ~.emacs~) remain
     hidden unless you invoke the ~-a~ option of ~ls~

[fn:4]An alternative (that takes much longer, because many files have
to be downloaded, and the Pi 3B+ isn't the strongest networker) is to
clone the entire ~os420~ repository with the command:
#+begin_example
  $ git clone https://github.com/birkenkrahe/os420
#+end_example

[fn:6]Answer: ~ls /~ lists the root directory, because ~/~ is root's
home. The particular ordering and naming of these directories is up to
the Linux OS file administrator, but there are certain style rules
that are usually obeyed by every professional.

[fn:5]Windows likes to call directories 'folders' - another
unnecessary dumbing down. A folder is just a container, but a
directory (like the "telephone directory") has a data structure, an
index, labels, and serves to search and find. Don't say "folder".

[fn:3]Unix manual pages are formatted with ~troff~, the Unix
"typsetter roff", a document processing system. "roff" stands for
"I'll run off a document".
