* Rasperry Pi 2 networking  <2022-01-05 Wed>
**  Problem
   WiFi dongle present (and powered - check with ~iwconfig
   -a~) but ~iwconfig~ shows no network activity, and ~ping~ is not
   working (website not recognized).

** Solution
   * Edit ~/etc/network/interfaces~ with the ~nano~ editor and put in
     the code block [[wlan]]. Put in the name (~ssid~) and WPA-~password~
     (you find these on your router), and save the file (~C-x y RET~).

   #+name: wlan
   #+begin_src sh
     # The loopback network interface
     auto lo
     iface lo inet loopback

     # The primary (wired) network interface
     iface eth0 inet dhcp

     # The wifi (wireless) network interface
     auto wlan0
     allow-hotplug wlan0
     iface wlan0 inet dhcp
     wpa-ssid "ssid"
     wpa-psk "password"
   #+end_src

   * Restart the Pi: ~sudo shutdown -r now~. Check that WiFi is up with [[iwconfig]]:
   #+name:iwconfig
   #+begin_src sh
     # display status of all interfaces
     iwconfig -a
     ping r-project.org
   #+end_src

   * ~sudo apt update~ and ~sudo apt upgrade -y~ to bring system up to
     date.
   * For WPA2/AES security, [[https://coderwall.com/p/v290ta/raspberry-pi-wifi-setup-with-wpa2-psk-aes][see here]].
   * To enable automatic reconnect, install ~wicd~.

* Installing GNU Emacs  <2022-01-05 Wed>
  I need my favorite editor on the Pi (though ~nano~ does a good job
  for simple tasks)!

  * Check available disk space with ~df -h~.
  * ~sudo apt install emacs~

* Create an ~ssh~ tunnel for remote access  <2022-01-05 Wed>

  * Enable ~ssh~ via the ~raspi-config~ menu
  * You can make sure that the service is up with ~sudo service
    --status-all~
  * For Windows: get ~PuTTY~ (MSI 64-bit x86 installer)
  * Get the IP address of the Pi with ~sudo hostname -I~. This will be
    the IP address on the local network (~192.168.0.XXX~)
  * Upon the first connect attempt, pick ~Access~ to establish the
    server's key (and make sure that it is trusted)
  * Login with the Pi's username and password, and you should be in.

    And now I'm running GNU Emacs over ~ssh~:
