* What is this?

  A place for irregular articles of possible interest to students of
  this course, mostly to avoid lengthy emails and to park content that
  I may want to develop later on, if I find the time.

  The public cross-course all-purpose diary is [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/diary.org][here in GitHub]].
