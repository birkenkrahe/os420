* What is this?

  Instead of bugging you with emails, I opt to summarize my course
  observations regarding content, process, in this file. These often
  contain additional links, articles, and musings.

  I usually update it after each class - it also contains the
  *homework* (if any). The first point of call for any questions
  should be the FAQ. There are two FAQs - a [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#frequently-asked-questions][general one]] (for all my
  courses), and a [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/os420/blob/main/FAQ.org][FAQ for CSC420]].
  
* Week 1 - Jan 11
** Homework (by Thursday 13-Jan)

   * [[https://github.com/][Register with GitHub]] (5 min)
   * Complete the [[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world][GitHub Hello World exercise]] (20 min)
   * +Give me your GitHub user name (email - with course ID - or
     Thursday in class)+ (no need - course is public)
   * Submit an issue to ~birkenkrahe/os420~ which confirms that you
     did the exercise!
     
** Stuff
   
  * [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/os420/blob/main/agenda.org][Agenda]] - we covered all of it (and more) - agenda is available in
    GitHub only

  * There's been a long and still open debate in software engineering
    and computer science about the importance of learning languages
    over learning concepts.

  * When people speak of Linux they usually mean the 'kernel' (the
    part of the OS that's always "on"). When they say GNU/Linux, they
    mean kernel + a bundle of functions. The word "kernel" contains
    the German word 'Kern' for nucleus, or core (which in turn, I
    think, comes from the Latin word for heart, 'cor').

  * Showed a few books to demonstrate the relevance of Linux and
    command line skills to cybersecurity:

  * [[https://www-zeuthen.desy.de/apewww/APE/software/asm/anext/][More about the APE]] (Ital. for "bee") parallel computer from the
    German particle lab DESY, Hamburg, and University of Rome La
    Sapienzia, Rome. Incidentally, one of the creators of this machine
    was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Parisi][Giorgio Parisi]], who recently received the Nobel Prize for
    physics 2021. One of my graduate student jobs was to take care of
    the first APE.

  * Showed Windows Cmd line, Windows PowerShell, and the ~bash~ shell,
    and summoned the wrath of Bill Gates by putting down Microsoft's
    attempts to provide half-hearted OS access. The GIF shows how the
    OS world might look like without Microsoft, Apple, Google:
    everybody's running Open Source (Linux)!

  * Demonstrated remotely accessing a Linux from a Windows box using
    ~ssh~ both on the shell and inside GNU Emacs (using the Tramp
    package and the program ~plink~, which is part of ~PuTTY~).
