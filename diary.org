* What is this?

  A place for irregular articles of possible interest to students of
  this course, mostly to avoid lengthy emails and to park content that
  I may want to develop later on, if I find the time.

  The public cross-course all-purpose diary is [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/diary.org][here in GitHub]].
* Getting ready to roll! (Jan-5-2022)

  Unpacked a couple of old Raspberry Pi's and got them going. The way
  this works (for me) is that I remember little and need to re-learn
  quite a bit - e.g. how to enable remote access (which is easier
  under Linux, but now I'm on Windows, alas).

  [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/os420/blob/main/pi/README.org][Taking notes]] as I go along. The upper pic is the first boot of my
  oldest Pi, a Rasperry Pi 2 B, the lower one shows the Pi-top, which
  is built on a Raspberry Pi 3 B+. I had installed Ubuntu Mate but I'm
  going back to Raspbian for the course.

  Unfortunately, I caught a flu, which slows me down but doesn't stop
  me from hacking away. My next mini-project is turning the Pi2 into a
  backup server for my work - it's sporting a 500GB SD card.
