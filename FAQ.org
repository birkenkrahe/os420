* How to connect your Pi to GDrive

  Sources: [[https://rclone.org/drive/][rclone.org/drive]], [[klauser][Klauser 2019]] (modified)

  1) Install rclone on Raspbian
     #+begin_example
     $ sudo apt-get install rclone
     #+end_example
  2) Change file permissions of ~$HOME/.config/rclone~ to ~rwx~ for
     owner only
     #+begin_example
     $ chmod 0700 ./.config/rclone  # change permissions
     $ ls -la ./.config/rclone      # check - you should see drwx------
     #+end_example
  3) Follow the detailed instructions in [[https://rclone.org/drive/][rclone.org/drive]] until you
     see the ~Success!~ web page after connecting rclone to GDrive
  
  #+begin_quote
  "Note that rclone runs a webserver on your local machine to collect
  the token as returned from Google if you use auto config mode. This
  only runs from the moment it opens your browser to the moment you
  get back the verification code. This is on http://127.0.0.1:53682/
  and this it may require you to unblock it temporarily if you are
  running a host firewall, or use manual mode."
  #+end_quote

  The access information is stored in
  ~$HOME/.config/rclone/rclone.conf~.

* Pi upgrade takes forever because of ~apt-listchanges~

  Every once in a while, one of the many Pi's that I have installed
  for use in the class hangs after trying to upgrade with ~sudo apt
  upgrade -y~. The solution to this is to abort (~C-c~) and remove the
  faulty package directly with:
  #+begin_example
   sudo apt-get remove apt-listchanges
  #+end_example
  Now restart the upgrading operation and it should run smoothly to
  the end.

* Footnotes

[fn:1]Using my private GMail account, I had to give my billing details
to do this. Developers usually create web services in the cloud that
incur costs based on traffic. I chose the ~Free trial~, however, which
comes with a $300 free credit. 

[fn:2]Cool side effect: you get a free Linux terminal from Google. Check it out:
