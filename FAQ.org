* Pi upgrade takes forever because of ~apt-listchanges~

  Every once in a while, one of the many Pi's that I have installed
  for use in the class hangs after trying to upgrade with ~sudo apt
  upgrade -y~. The solution to this is to abort (~C-c~) and remove the
  faulty package directly with:
  #+begin_example
   sudo apt-get remove apt-listchanges
  #+end_example
  Now restart the upgrading operation and it should run smoothly to
  the end.
