* What is this?

  Instead of bugging you with emails, I opt to summarize my course
  observations regarding content, process, in this file. These often
  contain additional links, articles, and musings.

  I usually update it after each class - it also contains the homework
  (if any). The relevant section is copied to Schoology (by hand,
  alas).

  First point of call for any questions should be the FAQ. There are
  two FAQs - a [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#frequently-asked-questions][general one]] (for all my courses), and a [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/os420/blob/main/FAQ.org][FAQ for CSC420]].
  
* Week 1 - Jan 11
  
  * [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/os420/blob/main/agenda.org][Agenda]] - we covered all of it (and more) - agenda is available in
    GitHub only

  * Showed a few books to demonstrate the relevance of Linux and
    command line skills to cybersecurity:

  * [[https://www-zeuthen.desy.de/apewww/APE/software/asm/anext/][More about the APE]] (Ital. for "bee") parallel computer from the
    German particle lab DESY, Hamburg, and University of Rome La
    Sapienzia, Rome. Incidentally, one of the creators of this machine
    was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Parisi][Giorgio Parisi]], who recently received the Nobel Prize for
    physics 2021. One of my graduate student jobs was to take care of
    the first APE.

  * Showed Windows Cmd line, Windows PowerShell, and the ~bash~
    shell, and summoned the wrath of Bill Gates by putting down
    Microsoft's attempts to provide half-hearted OS access 

    [[./img/marathon.gif]]
    
  * Demonstrated remotely accessing a Linux from a Windows box using
    ~ssh~ both on the shell and inside GNU Emacs (using the Tramp
    package and the program ~plink~, which is part of ~PuTTY~).
