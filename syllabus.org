** Objectives

   Operating systems manage a computer’s resources for its users and
   their applications. We focus on the underlying concepts, look at
   examples and try them out - my preferred sandbox being Linux, which
   you will be introduced to, including process management and simple
   shell programming. We also address concurrency and parallelization,
   cloud computing, memory, and storage management. In lab sessions,
   we use the Raspberry Pi as a platform to try stuff and get much
   closer to the machine than PC OS like Windows or MacOS allow. The
   lessons will directly lead to you feeling calm and powerful when
   working on your computer. A worthwhile investment! We will cover
   chapters from Silberschatz (2018), a standard text on OS concepts,
   and from Shotts (2019), a complete introduction to the Linux OS.

** Student Learning Outcomes

   Students who complete CSC 420 "Operating Systems (OS)", will be
   able to:

   * Understand how operating systems manage concurrent processes
   * Know OS design principles and implementation strategies
   * Know how to configure and run a Raspberry Pi-based Linux box
   * Use the command line interface and UNIX-style shell (~bash~)
   * Learn how to write simple shell scripts
   * Know how to process data with the shell
   * Know how to effectively present assignment results
   * Know principles and practice of virtualization

** Course requirements

   Some knowledge of, and experience with computers is useful but not
   critical: we will start from basic concepts. Curiosity and personal
   discipline are essential. You will gain data literacy skills by
   taking this course. The course will prepare you for further studies
   in computer and data science, or in other disciplines that use
   modern computing, i.e. every discipline, from accounting to
   zoology).

   For a deeper understanding of the concepts, familiarity with basic
   data structures, computer architecture, and a high-level language,
   such as C or Java, is useful.

** Grading system

   | WHEN[fn:1]    | DESCRIPTION          | IMPACT |
   |---------------+----------------------+--------|
   | Every session | Class assignments    |    10% |
   | Monthly       | Tests                |    30% |

   Schoology gradebook for the course.

*** Grading table

    This table is used to convert completion rates into letter
    grades. For the midterm results, letter grades still carry signs,
    while for the term results, only straight letters are given (by
    rounding up).

    |--------+---------------+---------------|
    |      *%* | *Midterm Grade* | *Final Grade*   |

* Standard Policies[fn:2]
** Honor Code

   All graded work in this class is to be pledged in accordance with
   the Lyon College Honor Code. The use of a phone for any reason
   during the course of an exam is considered an honor code
   violation.

** Class Attendance Policy

   Students are expected to attend all class periods for the courses
   in which they are enrolled. They are responsible for conferring
   with individual professors regarding any missed
   assignments. Faculty members are to notify the Registrar when a
   student misses the equivalent of one, two, three, and four weeks
   of class periods in a single course. Under this policy, there is
   no distinction between “excused” and “unexcused” absences, except
   that a student may make up work missed during an excused
   absence. A reminder of the college’s attendance policy will be
   issued to the student at one week, a second reminder at two weeks,
   a warning at three weeks, and notification of administrative
   withdrawal and the assigning of an “F” grade at four
   weeks. Students who are administratively withdrawn from more than
   one course will be placed on probation or suspended.

** Disabilities

   Students seeking reasonable accommodations based on documented
   learning disabilities must contact Interim Director of Academic
   Support Courtney Beal in the Morrow Academic Center at (870)
   307-7016 or at courtney.beal@lyon.edu.

** Harassment, Discrimination, and Sexual Misconduct

   Title IX and Lyon’s policy prohibit harassment, discrimination and
   sexual misconduct. Lyon encourages anyone experiencing harassment,
   discrimination or sexual misconduct to talk to Danell Hetrick,
   Title IX Coordinator and Interim Vice-President for Student Life,
   or Sh’Nita Mitchell, Title IX Investigator and Associate Dean for
   Students, about what happened so they can get the support they need
   and Lyon can respond appropriately.  Lyon is legally obligated to
   respond to reports of sexual misconduct, and therefore we cannot
   guarantee the confidentiality of a report, unless made to a
   confidential resource (Chaplain, Counselor, or Nurse). As a faculty
   member, I am required to report possible Title IX violations and
   must provide our Title IX coordinator with all relevant details.  I
   cannot, therefore, guarantee confidentiality.

** College-Wide COVID-19 Policies for Spring, 2022

   - Masks are mandated when indoors in all campus buildings,
     including academic buildings, Edwards Commons, Becknell Gymnasium
     and residence halls. Refer to the full campus policy online for
     more details.
   - Participation in community surveillance testing is mandatory.
   - Vaccines are STRONGLY encouraged for all faculty, staff, and
     students. Vaccines are NOT MANDATED for Lyon College community
     members.

   Details specific to this course may be found in the subsequent
   pages of this syllabus. Those details will include at least the
   following:
   - A description of the course consistent with the Lyon College catalog.
   - A list of student learning outcomes for the course.
   - A summary of all course requirements.
   - An explanation of the grading system to be used in the course.
   - Any course-specific attendance policies that go beyond the College policy.
   - Details about what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable
     student collaboration on graded work.

* Course specific information
** Assignments and Honor Code[fn:3]

   There will be numerous assignments during the semester - e.g.
   programming, lessons, tests, quizzes, and sprint reviews. They are
   due at the beginning of the class period on the due date. Once
   class begins, the assigment will be considered one day late if it
   has not been turned in.  Late programs will not be accepted without
   an extension. Extensions will *not* be granted for reasons such as:

   * You could not get to a computer
   * You could not get a computer to do what you wanted it to do
   * The network was down
   * The printer was out of paper or toner
   * You erased your files, lost your homework, or misplaced your
     flash drive
   * You had other coursework or family commitments that interfered
     with your work in this course

   Put “Pledged” and a note of any collaboration in the comments of
   any program you turn in. Programming assignments are individual
   efforts, but you may seek assistance from another student or the
   course instructor.  You may not copy someone else’s solution. If
   you are having trouble finishing an assignment, it is far better to
   do your own work and receive a low score than to go through an
   honor trial and suffer the penalties that may be involved.

   What is cheating on an assignment? Here are a few examples:

   * Having someone else write your assignment, in whole or in part
   * Copying an assignment someone else wrote, in whole or in part
   * Collaborating with someone else to the extent that your
     submissions are identifiably very similar, in whole or in part
   * Turning in a submission with the wrong name on it

   What is not cheating?  Here are some examples:

   * Talking to someone in general terms about concepts involved in an
     assignment
   * Asking someone for help with a specific error message or bug in
     your program
   * Getting help with the specifics of language syntax or citation
     style
   * Utilizing information given to you by the instructor

   Any assistance must be clearly explained in the comments at the
   beginning of your submission.  If you have any questions about
   this, please ask or review the policies relating to the Honor Code.

   Absences on Days of Exams:

   Test “make-ups” will only be allowed if arrangements have been
   made prior to the scheduled time.  If you are sick the day of the
   test, please e-mail me or leave a message on my phone before the
   scheduled time, and we can make arrangements when you return.
