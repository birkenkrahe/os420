* What is this?

  Instead of bugging you with emails, I opt to summarize my course
  observations regarding content, process, in this file. These often
  contain additional links, articles, and musings.

  I usually update it after each class - it also contains the
  *homework* (if any). The first point of call for any questions
  should be the FAQ. There are two FAQs - a [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org#frequently-asked-questions][general one]] (for all my
  courses), and a [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/os420/blob/main/FAQ.org][FAQ for CSC420]].

* 1.1 (01/11/22)
** Homework (by Thursday 13-Jan)

   * [[https://github.com/][Register with GitHub]] (5 min)
   * Complete the [[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world][GitHub Hello World exercise]] (20 min)
   * +Give me your GitHub user name (email - with course ID - or
     Thursday in class)+ (no need - course is public)
   * Submit an issue to ~birkenkrahe/os420~ which confirms that you
     did the exercise!

** Stuff

   * [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/os420/blob/main/agenda.org][Agenda]] - we covered all of it (and more) - agenda is available in
     GitHub only

   * There's been a long and still open debate in software engineering
     and computer science about the importance of learning languages
     over learning concepts.

   * When people speak of Linux they usually mean the 'kernel' (the
     part of the OS that's always "on"). When they say GNU/Linux, they
     mean kernel + a bundle of functions. The word "kernel" contains
     the German word 'Kern' for nucleus, or core (which in turn, I
     think, comes from the Latin word for heart, 'cor').

   * Showed a few books to demonstrate the relevance of Linux and
     command line skills to cybersecurity:

     [[./img/hackers.png]]

   * [[https://www-zeuthen.desy.de/apewww/APE/software/asm/anext/][More about the APE]] (Ital. for "bee") parallel computer from the
     German particle lab DESY, Hamburg, and University of Rome La
     Sapienzia, Rome. Incidentally, one of the creators of this
     machine was [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Parisi][Giorgio Parisi]], who received the Nobel Prize for
     physics 2021 for [[https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0205297][his work on complexity]] (Parisi, 2022). One of my
     graduate student jobs was to take care of the first APE.

   * Showed Windows Cmd line, Windows PowerShell, and the ~bash~ shell,
     and summoned the wrath of Bill Gates by putting down Microsoft's
     attempts to provide half-hearted OS access. The GIF shows how the
     OS world might look like without Microsoft, Apple, Google:
     everybody's running Open Source (Linux)!

     [[./img/marathon.gif]]

   * Demonstrated remotely accessing a Linux from a Windows box using
     ~ssh~ both on the shell and inside GNU Emacs (using the Tramp
     package and the program ~plink~, which is part of ~PuTTY~).

* 1.2 (01/13/22)
** GitHub assignment/DataCamp

   * DataCamp: You should all be in your courses now.
     - Your assignments are on one page but you'll be notified via
       schoology as soon as an assignment is due

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   #+caption: DataCamp OS course member list
   [[./img/members.png]]

   * Importance of README files for packages that (super) users can
     build from source for their computer architecture (CPU) and OS

   * Git is about version control, developed by Linus Torvalds, who
     also is the ~main~ branch maintainer for the Linux kernel. Here
     is [[https://github.com/torvalds/linux][his GitHub repo with the kernel]].

   * This is what I was thinking of - worth watching: [[https://youtu.be/V5S8kFvXpo4][The Computer
     Chronicles - Operating Systems (1984)]]

     #+attr_html: :width 400px
     #+caption: Computer chronicles-OS (1984)
     [[./img/history.png]]

     * However, my first thought, [[https://youtu.be/KG-mqHoXOXY][History of Databases (2019)]] is also
       really relevant for OS, because it shows how an important
       application (database management systems) is developed in concert
       with the operating systems on which it runs

** Lecture on OS foundations

   * Why different models? Each POV is a different model. Models change
     with time and represent focus and interests (e.g. IT careers)

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   #+caption: OS and computer hardware w/peripherals
   [[./img/hw.png]]

   * Diversity of architecture is like gaming success: a team
     consisting of 1 wizard + 1 dwarf + 1 elf has better chances to
     win than teams of three of each.

   #+attr_html: :width 400px
   #+caption: Architecture of Information Systems (ARIS) model
   [[./img/aris.png]]

   * Distinguish between PCs (solo), workstations (group, specific
     apps), and mainframe. They have different OS types.

** GNU Emacs installation

   #+attr_html: :width 600px
   #+caption: Real Programmers Use Emacs (Source: xkcd).
   [[./img/real_programmers.png]]

   * xkcd (xkcd.com) is a cartoonist/nerd with a healthy appreciation
     for IT and computing (and also science)
   * ~nano~ is a tiny GNU/Linux based editor
   * ~vim~ is another (slightly larger) GNU/Linux based editor
     (available for Windows and Mac)
   * ~ed~ is another editor, and ~sed~ on GNU/Linux is important for
     data science on the command line
   * ~cat~ is a viewing program

   * GNU Emacs v27 Windows installation: you need the
     ~emacs-27.1-x86_64-installer.exe~ [[http://gnu.freemirror.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-27/][from this page]].

* 2.1 (01/18/22)

** Quiz - feedback

   * Too much time? Too little? Questions too hard? Too easy?
   * You should be able to see the correct solutions for rehearsal

** Review - OS position and purpose

   ABSTRACTION[fn:1]:
   * The computer can be viewed from different angles (models):
     - Computer architecture (e.g. ARIS or CPU+RAM+HD)
     - User + applications + OS + hardware

   ARBITRATION[fn:2]:
   * The main (defining) job of the OS is to control and allocate
     computer resources
   * Users want easy of use + performance
   * Shared computers include mainframes and dedicated workstations

   DEFINITION:
   * The OS kernel is the program that runs on your computer at all
     times, and is always in memory

   | COMPUTER PROGRAMS            | EXAMPLES           |
   |------------------------------+--------------------|
   | Operating System (OS) kernel | ~systemd~ /daemon/ |
   | System (control) programs    | ~bash~ /shell/     |
   | Application (user) programs  | ~emacs~ editor     |

** Log - from bootloading to interrupts

   #+caption: A computer system (Source: Silberschatz et al, 2018)

   [[./img/system.png]]

   * Computer hardware = Motherboard (run) + Peripherals (I/O)

   * In the past, application software had to explicitly be connected
     and configured to the operating system (MS DOS, Apple DOS, CP/M)

* Glossary

[fn:2]Word origin: /arbitrari/ (Latin) = to resolve a dispute [because
on a computer many different parties compete for available resources]

[fn:1]Word origin: /abs-trahere/ (Latin) = to withdraw [from
details] - abstraction is the opposite of specialization (add detail)
