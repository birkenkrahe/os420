* README

  * [ ] Before working through this file, make sure you completed the
    getting started guide in ~start_nb.org~.

  * [ ] You can hide/open headers and codeblocks with the <TAB> key

  * You can get this file and the ~.emacs~ file from GDrive

  * You can get Unix tools to do this at home on your Windows box by
    installing Cygwin, but not all the commands will work in Windows.

* Building a playground

  * Change to your ~$HOME~ directory
  * Print your working directory
  * Make a directory ~playground~
  * Switch on the verbose option
  * Check that it worked using the wildcard ~play*~
  * [ ] Check task group

  #+name: mkdir_playground
  #+begin_src bash
    cd $HOME

  #+end_src

* Creating directories

  * Change directory to ~playground~[fn:1] - do this in every code
    block!
  * Print your working directory
  * Make two directories ~dir1~ and ~dir2~
  * Switch on the verbose option
  * Check that it worked using the wildcard ~*[0-9]~
  * [ ] Check task group

  #+name: make_dirs
  #+begin_src bash
    cd ~/playground

  #+end_src

* Copying files

  * Copy ~/etc/passwd~ into the current working directory
  * Switch on the verbose option
  * Check that it worked using the wildcard ~pass??~
  * [ ] Check task group

  #+name: copy_file
  #+begin_src bash
    cd ~/playground

  #+end_src

* Moving and renaming files

  * Change the name of ~passwd~ to ~fun~
  * Switch on the verbose option
  * Check that it worked with the wildcard ~*fun*~
  * [ ] Check task group

  #+name: move_file
  #+begin_src bash
    cd ~/playground

  #+end_src

  * Move the renamed file ~fun~ to directory ~dir1~
  * Check that it worked with ~ls -l~
  * Move ~fun~ from ~dir1 to ~dir2~ in one command
  * Check that it worked with ~ls -l~
  * Move ~fun~ back to the current working directory
  * Check that it worked with ~ls -l~
  * [ ] Check task group

  #+name: move_file_to_dir
  #+begin_src bash
    cd ~/playground

  #+end_src

  * Move file ~fun~ into ~dir1~ again
  * Move directory ~dir1~ into ~dir2~
  * Confirm that the file is there with ~ls -l~
  * [ ] Check task group

  #+name: move_dir_to_dir
  #+begin_src bash
    cd ~/playground

  #+end_src

  * Note that ~dir1~ was moved into ~dir2~ because it existed
  * If it had not existed, ~dir1~ would have been renamed ~dir2~
  * Put everthing back and confirm at the end with ~ls -l~
  * [ ] Check task group

  #+name: move_back
  #+begin_src bash
    cd ~/playground

  #+end_src

* Creating hard links

  * Create a hard link ~fun-hard~ to ~fun~ in ~./~
  * Create a hard link ~fun-hard~ to ~fun~ in ~dir1~
  * Create a hard link ~fun-hard~ to ~fun~ in ~dir2~
  * Switch on the verbose option for ~ln~
  * Confirm with ~ls -l ./~ and with ~ls -l dir*~
  * [ ] Check task group

  #+name: hard
  #+begin_src bash
    cd ~/playground

  #+end_src

  * The number ~4~ in the listing is the number of hard links that
    exist for the file (including the default link)
  * Show that ~fun~ and ~fun-hard~ are indeed the same files
  * [ ] Check task group

  #+name: inode
  #+begin_src bash
    cd ~/playground

  #+end_src

* Creating symbolic links

  * Create a symlink ~fun-sym~ to ~fun~ in ~./~
  * Create a symlink ~fun-sym~ to ~fun~ in ~dir1~
  * Create a symlink ~fun-sym~ to ~fun~ in ~dir2~
  * Switch on the verbose option for ~ln~
  * Confirm with ~ls -l ./~ and with ~ls -l dir*~
  * [ ] Check task group

  #+name: soft
  #+begin_src bash
    cd ~/playground

  #+end_src

  * Create a symlink ~dir1-sym~ to ~dir1~ in ~./~
  * [ ] Check task group

  #+name: soft_dir
  #+begin_src bash
    cd ~/playground

  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: soft_dir

* Removing files and directories

  * Remove the hard link ~fun-hard~ in ~./~
  * Confirm with ~ls -l~
  * [ ] Check task group

  #+name: rm_hard
  #+begin_src bash
    cd ~/playground
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS: rm_hard

  * Remove ~fun~ and switch on verbose option[fn:4]
  * Confirm with ~ls -l~
  * [ ] Check task group

  #+name: rm_fun
  #+begin_src bash
    cd ~/playground

  #+end_src

  * [ ] Check that ~fun-sym~ is broken with ~less~ (don't do this in
    Emacs, but change to a proper terminal). You should get:
  #+begin_example
    fun-sym: No such file or directory
  #+end_example

  * Remove the symbolic links (switch on verbose option)
  * Confirm with ~ls -l~
  * [ ] Check task group

  #+name: rm_sym
  #+begin_src bash
    cd ~/playground

  #+end_src

  * Go ~$HOME~ and remove the playground (with verbose option)
  * Check with ~ls -vl playground~
  * [ ] Check task group

  #+name: rm_playground
  #+begin_src bash

  #+end_src

  * Save this file with ~C-x C-s~
  * Kill the buffer with ~C-x k~ (confirm)
  * [ ] Check task group
  
  You may close Emacs!

* Footnotes

[fn:3]Unfortunately, this command downloads a HTML file. I have not
been able to find out (yet) how to tweak ~wget~ to download the Org
file. Perhaps one of you want to give it a try!?

[fn:2]In Org-mode, you need to use the ~:cmdline~ header argument and
redirect the input, in this case from a file ~y.txt~ that only
contains the character ~y~.

[fn:1]If you work with code blocks inside Emacs, you may have to
resort to absolute filenames to make sure that you are where you want
to be.
